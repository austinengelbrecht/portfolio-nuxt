      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I had my first experience with web development years ago when I built a
        small website as a class project. The first website I coded was rough
        around the edges, but it sent me down a path of continuous learning and
        development. Now, almost four years later, I am continuing to learn
        little by little every day; finding myself naturally curious with a
        drive to continue growing my skills in web development.

        Outside of work I love learning new technology and tinkering with
        electronics. I also enjoy playing casual video games with my friends, or
        finding a new trail to hike. I'm also currently learning how to
        fly-fish, which is an exciting challenge to keep me outdoors.
