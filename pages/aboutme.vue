      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I had my first experience with web development years ago when I built a
        small website as a class project. The first website I coded was crude,
        yet it ignited a spark of continuous learning and development. Now,
        almost four years later, I am continuing to learn little by little every
        day; finding myself naturally curious with a drive to continue growing
        my skills in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professoinally, I primarily work with Elm and SCSS to build front-end
        pages. While, ocassionally working with .NET Razor or React, when the
        need arises.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working in Vue and Nuxt on my personal projects. I find personal
        projects are a great way to relax while also continuing to develop my
        coding and web development skills.

      <h2>Outside of the Office</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work I have many different interests. I enjoy lifting weights
        to relief stress and keep healthy. I also enjoy the occasional hike or
        bike ride to get outside and experience the beauty of nature. And
        recently, I have been learning how to fly-fish on the weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the weather doesn't let me get outside, I enojoy playing casual
        video games with my friends, or curling up on the couch and watching a
        good movie or TV show.
